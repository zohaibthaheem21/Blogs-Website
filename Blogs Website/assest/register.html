        Although we’re referring to it as an “error” for the purposes of this post, the “Sorry, you are not allowed to access this page” message in WordPress is meant to be a helpful security measure.

        Ultimately, seeing this notification simply means there’s a permissions setting that’s blocking you from a certain area.
        
        This becomes a problem when you’re locked out of a part of your site that you should have permission to enter which, as an Administrator, is anywhere on the backend. When this situation arises, it is often following a recent update to a theme, plugin, or WordPress core.
        
        Need to give a shoutout here. Kinsta is amazing, I use it for my personal website. The support is rapid and outstanding, and their servers are the fastest for WordPress.

        You may see the “Sorry, you are not allowed to access this page” message for a variety of reasons. It might be that WordPress doesn’t recognize you as an Administrator. In other situations, the information contained in your site’s core code or in a theme or plugin may not match what’s in your database.


        
        Additional causes include incorrect information in your wp-config.php file or a site that’s running an outdated version of PHP. Whatever the source, this error may prevent you from accessing the entire admin area or just a portion of it.


        
        Since it’s likely that you will not be able to access key settings via the dashboard, you’ll need to use File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or phpMyAdmin to resolve this issue. Make sure to back up your site and brush up on using these platforms before you dive into the troubleshooting process.</pre>
